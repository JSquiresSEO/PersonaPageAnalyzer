LOAD THE EXTENSION: 
Click the "Load unpacked" button on the top-left. A file browser will open. Navigate to and select the folder you unzipped in step 1. The "Persona Page Analyzer" will now appear in your list of extensions and in your Chrome toolbar (you may need to click the puzzle piece icon to pin it).
